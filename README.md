# ChurchSuite Plan Viewer
## Copyright (C) 2025 Richard Huss

This program provides a simple way to view and print service plans prepared
in [ChurchSuite](https://churchsuite.com/).

Ultimately, I hope that it will allow more customised plan formats to be printed,
and for those formats to be edited. But in this initial version, it is geared
to the specific needs of [Elmdon Church](https://www.elmdonchurch.org/) to help us
transition from Planning Center to ChurchSuite.
