title: ChurchSuite Plan Viewer
---
This program by [Richard Huss](https://github.com/hussra) provides a simple way to view and print service plans prepared
in [ChurchSuite](https://churchsuite.com/).

It was initially geared to the specific needs of [Elmdon Church](https://www.elmdonchurch.org/)
to help us transition from Planning Center to ChurchSuite, but now allows for additional plan
formats to be printed, and for those formats to be edited in the built-in template editor.
