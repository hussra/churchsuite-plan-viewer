# Setting Up ChurchSuite Plan Viewer
This guide will help you set up and configure the ChurchSuite Plan Viewer application. First download and install
the application from the [releases page](https://github.com/hussra/churchsuite-plan-viewer/releases).

When it first runs, it will show the **Authentication Settings** section, asking for a Client Identifier and Client Secret.
