# Installation and Setup
This guide will help you set up and configure the ChurchSuite Plan Viewer application.

## Setting up access
Before you can use ChurchSuite Plan Viewer, you will need to set up a user account in ChurchSuite and grant "API access".
To do this, first log into ChurchSuite as a user with administator privileges, click on your profile top right, and go to
**Settings**, then **Users**.

Click **Add User** and set up the new user account. I recommend you use the same username as your regular account, with `_api`
added at the end. Give user a name that clearly indicates its purpose. Under **Module Permissions**, give **Use** access 
to the Planning module - no other permissions are required.

Once you have saved the new user, click ... More and choose **Enable API Access**.

Now log out, and log in as your newly created user.

Click on your profile top right, and choose **My profile**.

Click into the **Secrets** tab which will now be visible, and click **Add secret**.

Enter a name (I used **ChurchSuite Plan Viewer**) and confirm your password.

Your new API secret will be shown - it will not be possible to view it again once you have closed the dialog. Easiest to keep it on the screen
until you have installed and run the program.

## Installing the program
Now you can download and install ChurchSuite Plan Viewer from the [releases page](https://github.com/hussra/churchsuite-plan-viewer/releases).

When it first runs, it will show the **Authentication Settings** section, asking for a Client Identifier and Client Secret.
Enter the Client Identifier and Client Secret you got from ChurchSuite above.

Once successfully connected, the **Authentication Settings** section will be hidden and you will see on the left a panel allowing you to select
a plan, template and other settings, and on the right a preview of the selected plan.
