# Using the program
Once the program is [installed and set up](setup.md), usage is straightforward.

You will create and edit your service plans within ChurchSuite itself as usual. ChurchSuite Plan Viewer steps in
once you have a plan in ChurchSuite, and are ready to print it.

The main window of the program is divided into two areas.
* On the left are key settings to help you to:
  * select a plan
  * select a "template" that will be used to display the plan - different templates will show different
    subsets of the information from ChurchSuite
  * configure aspects of how the plan will be formatted and save it as a PDF file.
* On the right, you will see a preview of the selected plan, using the template you have chosen

## Selecting a plan
The first set of controls will help you to find and select the plan you want to work with.

By default, the **Select a plan** drop-down (1 in the screenshot above) will let you choose from among the next (up to) 10 upcoming published plans.
Next to it is the **Refresh** button (2 in the screenshot) which will reload the list of plans from ChurchSuite, and reload the selected plan, picking
up any changes you have made within ChurchSuite.

You can change which plans are shown using the other controls:
* **Show past plans** (3)
* **Show draft plans** (4), and
* **Number of plans to show** (5).

## Selecting a template
The next important control is the **Select a template** drop-down.

The **Select a template** drop-down (6 in the screenshot above) will let you choose a template to view your service plan.
ChurchSuite Plan Viewer comes with two templates out-of-the-box:
* **Outline Running Order** simply displays the name of each item in your plan, and the people associated with it
* **Full Service Order** displays much fuller details of your plan, including the text of any liturgy and prayers.

Next to the drop-down, the **Edit templates** button (7 in the screenhot) launches the [template editor](editor.md).

## Additional options
Next come some further options to refine the program's output. The **Default name style** drop-down lets you choose how
you would like names to be displayed next to service items:

Finally, you can choose the output page size, select whether you would like two copies per sheet (we use this to create
A5 orders of service using the "outline running order" template), and then click the **Create PDF** button to save
and open a PDF file showing the selected service, using your chosen template and other options.
